# Programming_for_Data_Analysis_Project
Project for Programming for Data Analysis Dec 2018

This project aims to investigate the real world phenomenon of
 - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least        four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
-  Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
