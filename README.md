# Programming for Data Analysis Project
Project for Programming for Data Analysis Dec 2018

This project aims to investigate the real world phenomenon of
 - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least        four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
-  Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

## The Problem
The success of Padraig Harrington's professional golf career has been driven by the scores he shoots in tournaments around the world. This notebook will aim to analyse round by round scores for Harrington's entire professional career to predict his finishing positions in tournaments. The data comes from tour-tips.com.

The Prog_for_DA.ipynb file in this folder is where the analysis is done. The file is a python jupyter notebook, which is an interactive python file. If there are any issues with the file you should start from the top and run the code cell by cell.
